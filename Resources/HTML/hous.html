                    I worked with teammates Marc Estruch Tena, Rae Lasko, and Michelle Tai to construct a codesign session between designers and legal Hispanic immigrants in South Los Angeles to empower immigrants to understand, disseminate information about, and ultimately not sign unlawful housing contracts. Through thinking critically about stakeholders to be present, information design, group cohesion aspects, and more, we believe our co-design session will bring value through co-constructing and co-designing several feasible solutions that will help legal immigrants recognize illegal housing contracts and by eventually reducing the amount of signed unlawful contracts by empowering immigrants to take precautions.

                    For this project, we were to select a problem space to create a useful and memorable co-design session for stakeholders. From a list of four selections–immigrant crime, opioid epidemic, food waste, and emergency response–we chose to focus on immigrant crimes. 
                    One key insight we found when we first looked into immigration and crimes was that U.S. immigrants had lower incarceration rates that native-born U.S. citizens. Cities with concentrated immigration are safer than those that are more dispersed together with native-born U.S. citizens. We found that with crimes against both legal and illegal immigrants, many are unreported and as a result, go undetected. For legal immigrants especially, this was an injustice that deemed a necessary change. 
                    We quickly brainstormed the stakeholders to find pain points we can address in a social design.

                    As seen in our stakeholder map above, two key issues emerged where legal immigrants who have no reason to be treated unjustly are being treated so because few immigrants follow through reporting the crime and crimes ranged from petty crimes to violent crimes. Since the lack of reporting is the core of the problem to native born U.S. citizens taking advantage of immigrants, our initial goal was to increase self-reporting of crimes. We also discussed the merit of tackling petty crimes or violent crimes in our social design. We saw that focusing on violent crimes first was similar to addressing the problem bottom up while choosing to address petty crimes first was similar to a top down approach. Focusing to curb severe crimes against immigrants from the start is ideal, but because of the factors including the knowledge to report and differences in cultural norms, this approach seemed infeasible. Learning to address petty crimes before violent crimes allow immigrants to put their foot in the door, to feel empowered to better their life situations, and to feel compelled to tackle more difficult problems. As a result, we wanted to focus on the goal of our social design to increase self-reporting of petty crimes as a way of introduction for immigrants to take control of further crimes perpetrated against them. We envisioned a more accessible understanding of available rights, procedures, and recourse. <br><br>
                    Specifically, we decided to focus our problem selection on discrimination faced by legal immigrants in the housing market, particularly the prevalence of unfair housing contracts. Due to cultural and language barriers, recent immigrant tenants are not always aware of the rights they have. Compared to the home countries of many of these immigrants (China, South American countries, and some European countries), the US has housing laws that are very fair and even in favor of immigrants. As a result, these immigrants often don’t know they’re able to insist on what natives simply expect, such as timely repairs, extermination, fair notice for lease termination and a host of other rights.

                   With the initial goal to increase self-reporting of petty crimes and to offer tools for immigrants to take action in recourse, we thought that we would approach the design with a social approach as opposed to a political or micro approach. Our initial iteration aimed to have an education component that tied with action. In this way, we hoped that immigrants would gain ownership in obtaining knowledge and understanding of how reporting crimes worked and to help others in their neighborhood through outlets such as forums or interactive displays. With more reporting happening, we hoped that the long-term goal for this initial design allows for immigrants to be perceived as equals to native born U.S. citizens so that fewer crimes would be perpetrated against them. <br><br>
                   As we kept iterating upon our initial idea, we scoped our design to be more specific in participants, location, and type of activities and information that were generated. This gave us a specific demographic and local spaces we targeted to readily involve everyone we chose. The process of scoping led us to shift from a social approach in our social design to a micro approach. Our latest design of a co-design session followed a time-bounded situation where we target a specific neighborhood location (South Los Angeles in our case) of a specific demographic who are experiencing hardships with crimes being perpetrated against them (immigrant Hispanics). Thinking about the location in which we may host a co-design session led us to be geographically bounded and focused by a micro approach that aligned with our newly-scoped goal of designing a solution to help immigrants with the knowledge to better understand their contracts and to eventually not sign unlawful contracts.

                   Jose is a legal immigrant from Mexico. He lives in South LA and sees a lot of crime happen around his neighborhood, but never sees an official report on the LAPD site. <br><br>
                    Scenarios: Jose <br><br>
                    1. Jose uses an emergency app in his native language that has a FAQ section and a way to report crime directly. <br>
                    2. Jose speaks to a CUI on his phone when he gets beaten up by the local gang. It talks to him about his rights and suggests recourse and walks him through how to report the crime. <br>
                    3. Upon entrance to the US, Jose sits through an informational session about his rights and expected procedures in the case that crime is committed against him. <br>
                    4. Facilitate immigrant organized informational sessions within the community relating to rights and crime. Jose gets to talk to fellow immigrants about his own experiences with crime and reporting. 
                    5. Jose uses a forum to inform others of crimes that are happening in real time. <br>
                    6. Collected information is transmitted to Police Department to help inform the deployment of police officers. <br>
                    7. When Jose notices that some of his items have been stolen from his house while he was at work, he uses an app to log details of the crime. The report is sent to a volunteer lawyer who helps Jose through the legal process. <br>
                    8. Jose receives a practice crime session that occurs at random at his workplace for him to learn what his rights and procedure are in a real case situation. <br>
                    9. Jose is taking the bus to work, and he observes the banner advertisements on the side of the bus. One has a website he can visit to learn more about his rights as an immigrant, and he is able to pull that website up on his phone discreetly, reading on his way to work. <br>
                    10. Jose is leaving his apartment building for work in the morning, and he stops by the community room to grab a coffee. Above the coffee machine is a dot map with pins where you can anonymously mark areas of the neighborhood where you have felt unsafe or experienced violence. The pins are color-coded by race, so Jose and others can tell which parts of the city may be unsafe for people of specific racial backgrounds. <br>
                    11. Jose goes to a community church where there are pamphlets about resources for immigrants who may have been the victims of certain crimes. He is able to pick up a pamphlet in the discretion of his own community. <br>
                    12. Jose’s church starts a task force meant to support immigrants and to connect them with resources if they have been the victim of a crime. The task force pays special attention to church members when they seen them and are taught to recognize signals of abuse. <br>
                    13. Jose goes to confession at church and inside the confessional stalls are resources to help immigrants better know their rights and gain support. After talking with the priest about recent abuse he has faced as an immigrant, the priest directs him towards some of the pamphlets, and Jose is able to subtly take one without anyone else seeing as he leaves the confessional. <br>
                    14. Jose returns home to see that he has been robbed. He goes to a website his neighbor mentioned him, where he can find support from volunteers to take action and report his situation. He shortly gets contacted by a volunteer lawyer who helps him with the process. <br>
                    15. Jose gets hit by a car while he was biking. The driver runs out of the scene but he gets the license plate. However, he doesn’t know if that is useful. He decides to share the story in an anonymous sharing questions app and he gets answers of what to do with the license plate from other users. <br>
                    16. Jose got scammed from the taxi driver that took him to the doctor. He felt helpless and confused. He opens the anonymous reporting app and shares his story and his information appears in the map together will the rest of the reportings. <br>
                    17. Jose arrives at LAX and like the last 15 times, he gets the “random check” at the borders. He feels frustrated every time, so he decides to share his experiences with fellow Mexicans on the new twitter like app that allows him to do it anonymously. <br>
                    18. Jose is driving his car when he get pulled over by the police for allegedly having one break bulb broken. He wants to rebate these accusations but he doesn’t know what to do. He gets the volunteer lawyer app to find someone who can advise him what to do. <br>
                    19. Jose is visiting a family member for dinner in a neighborhood with which he is not familiar. He is concerned about returning home in the dark from a neighborhood that may feel dangerous to him. He is able to open an app with a dot map of racial violence in different neighborhoods in L.A. so he can better assess his surroundings for potential dangers. <br>
                    20. Jose feels like his boss may be racially discriminating against him. He is not sure of whether or not his feelings are justified and what he can do about it, so he opens an app to learn more about his rights, privileges, and resources. <br>

                    1. “Round-rug” discussion of frequent unfair or illegal aspects of housing contracts. <br> <br>
                    In a small breakout session, immigrants and experts will sit around a round rug on the floor. Each immigrant will have a real housing contract brought in by the fair housing lawyers that has unfair and illegal elements. After a brief explanation of key terms to look out for, the immigrants will work together to highlight clauses they think are unfair. Experts will work with them to point out signifiers they should look out for and help them find clauses they missed. <br>
                    We chose to utilize round rugs to make the immigrants feel more at ease and equal to the lawyers. This part of the co-design session will inform the participants of elements that are unfair both to prepare them for their upcoming housing search (where they will likely have to review some housing contracts themselves) and suggest ways to help other immigrants in a similar position. <br><br>
                    2. Small group shuffle - 1 lawyer and 4-5 immigrants per a group <br> <br>
                    By keeping the ratio of immigrant to lawyers high, we hope to put the immigrants at ease to have a productive discussion. <br><br>
                    3. Roll dice and generate an idea for disseminating information. Present to group. <br> <br>
                    Each group will roll the three dice and come up with an idea involving those three elements (more specifics in later sections). This portion should be quick and high in energy. Because of the elements we’ve selected to be on the dice, we expect many of the solutions to be whimsical and impractical. <br> We’ll make this clear before the dice rolling starts by pointing out some unusual technology like “smell displays” and “drones”. Each group will have a minute to quickly pitch their idea to the rest of the crowd. We’ll record each on a whiteboard for reference. Ideally, an immigrant would present, but if not, the lawyer is free to volunteer. We hope the presentation of outlandish ideas will lead to some laughs and camaraderie. <br> <br>
                    4. Repeat twice! <br> <br>
                    Step 3 will be repeated twice, with a shuffling of groups each time to keep ideas fresh. <br> <br>
                    5. Idea synthesis - improving on previous pitches <br> <br>
                    The participants will be split into 3 larger groups of 10-12 people each. Drawing on elements from one or more previous ideas, the groups will try to come up with a version of the ideas that are more practical and feasible. Each group will present their ideas. <br> <br>
                    6. Conclusory remarks <br> <br>
                    To conclude the session, the experts will give a short talk (no more than 15 minutes) on potential implementations of the ideas they heard. They will also point out what they learned from working with the immigrants to reinforce the idea that everyone participated in a round-rug conversation.

                    We started out by approaching the problem of crimes against immigrants. We were struck by how popular perception of immigrants as criminals is so severely mismatched by the actual prevalence of people perpetrating crimes against immigrants. We looked at websites that tracked crimes against immigrants, explored the ideas of in-group/ out-group bias, and thought of how to tackle the issue of crimes against both legal and illegal immigrants. However, after receiving feedback that our scope was going to be challengingly-wide to find appropriate solutions for all types of stakeholders involved, we decided to scope down and to try to find one type of primary stakeholder or one type of crime to address. After thinking about different, common crimes perpetrated against immigrants, we decided to tackle housing crimes, and specifically, illegal housing contracts. Due to the challenge of mitigating emotional, cultural, and language differences in a crime so prevalent within immigrant communities, we realized that this was the challenge we wanted to set our sights on. <br> <br>
                    We decided to focus in on the importance of reporting crimes perpetrated against immigrants-- because of stigma, language, and citizenship boundaries, crimes against immigrants are also underreported. We thought about looking for ways to streamline reporting within immigrant communities and also started to think about the technology that would be involved in a reporting system.

                    This early block diagram helped us define the problem space in a way that was easier to understand. At this stage, we wanted to increase immigrant reporting of crime. First, at the bottom, we listed ways we might spread information or otherwise empower immigrants. We knew we would need to provide security in order for the users to trust us. We also wanted to be mindful of culture and language barriers. Finally, we would educate and inform immigrants through the use of visualizations. At the top is our goal-- to increase immigrant reporting of crime that would result in decreased crime against immigrants. <br><br>
                    However, after receiving feedback about the challenges of such a wide scope, we decided to look at the more specific situation of housing crimes against immigrants. We decided that our participants in the co-design session should be community leaders that hold weight in the community, lawyers, real estate brokers, and politicians friendly to immigrant causes. We decided to focus on community leaders in immigrant communities instead of all immigrants because we thought these leaders would be able to more comfortably interact with experts in the housing process and may already know some of the experts from other meetings in the community. After deciding to look at housing crimes against immigrants, we tried to focus on types of activities that we could carry out during our co-design section. We brainstormed that there were about 3 categories for our solution: the how, or the technology used for the solution, what, the content or context of the technology, and where, the location of the solution, and this became our later block diagram.

                    However instead of simply having people try to match solutions against these different categories, which we perceived might feel like an incomprehensible starting point for brainstorming, we came across the idea of using dice to randomly assign participants one response from each of the categories so they could start to think of solutions that combined those 3 elements. This element of randomness might encourage outlandish suggestions, but it might also lead to great and interesting solutions. We would use 3, 10-sided dice, with each dice corresponding to the how, the what, and the where of the solution, and each face of the dice corresponding to suggestions for technology, context, and location for the solution. Afterwards, we chose other activities for our co-design session around the idea of brainstorming using dice that would complement our co-design goals of understanding and reduction of unlawful contracts signed. We decided to start with experts reviewing housing contracts in order to help immigrants understand what clauses may signify potentially unlawful behavior. Then, we decided to split into groups with just one expert in each group, so the immigrants would be able to feel that they their voices were heard. Afterwards, we decided to iterate over our dice idea, having immigrants roll the dice and come up with combinations for potential solutions multiple times, and then synthesizing those ideas into a better idea to present to the group. Lastly, we wanted the experts to talk about the potential implementation of the ideas, so solutions would not just stay within in the session; instead, they would be able to be taken and developed further in the future with input from primary stakeholders, leaders in the immigrant community, and subject-matter expertise from experts. Since the faces of the dice would match up with technological ideas for the how, the what, and the where of the solution, we also wanted to stress that we, as designers, would be circulating around the room in order to answer any questions or to help explain any technologies.

                    After receiving feedback on the above original poster design, agenda for the session, and corresponding instructions for what each face of the dice means, we realized that just being around to answer questions may not be enough to explain the technologies. Immigrants who may be less comfortable with English and technology would be doubly uncomfortable with advanced technologies and explanations of them in English. Therefore, we decided to create technology cards translated into Spanish, to plan to bring sample technologies to the session to help visualize the technologies, on top of circulating for questions.

                    After better explaining the technologies involved in the possible solution, our last step was to tie it all together in a final presentation. However, we felt as though something was missing and we did not know quite how to see how our potential primary stakeholders would engage in this co-design process. We wanted to make sure our stakeholders were comfortable, and we believed we had done that through bilingual lawyers and translated technologies cards, but we were missing a key issue. After asking for feedback, we realized what that issue was: we were not making sure our participants were feeling emotionally comfortable. Looking for housing can be scary for anyone, and it can be even scarier if you don’t speak the language, don’t know what resources you have, and don’t know how to know whether or not you are being treated fairly by landlords. <br><br>
                    Therefore, we sought to take additional steps to improve the emotional well-being of our participants throughout this session . We started thinking about what would make us most comfortable, and we realized that our communities and homes make us feel comfortable. Therefore, we decided to base our co-design session in a specific community: the church community. We selected Iglesia de Cristo Camino de Santidad, a church in South Los Angeles with an 80% Hispanic immigrant population as our co-design setting, and we decided to hold our session in the church basement after Sunday service. At this point, the church itself felt like a safer environment, and since this session would be held after Sunday service, all participants would be in their “Sunday best,” and lawyers would not feel as intimidating, in their suits and ties. <br><br> Furthermore, we wanted the immigrants to feel empowered throughout every activity, and we realized that the initial activity of lawyers reviewing housing contracts that immigrants bring in might feel intimidating or embarrassing, especially if immigrants don’t fully understand the language being used in their housing contracts. Therefore, we changed step one of our agenda to participants highlighting unfair clauses in sample housing contracts in order for this to be more of an active, learning activity, instead of potentially feeling like a lecture. We also changed our participants from community leaders, lawyers, brokers, and us, to immigrants, lawyers, and members of the community. Previously, we felt that having so many experts would be informative, but then we realized, that by excluding the primary stakeholders, the immigrants themselves, we were missing an integral part of the puzzle. Furthermore, by downsizing the expert population and integrating community and church members, we sought to keep our primary stakeholders comfortable to share their opinions. Lastly, we really wanted our co-design session to feel like an equitable share of the conversation for immigrants, so instead of having our discussions around round tables, we decided to have our activities on round rugs on the floor, with holdable whiteboards in the middle of each rug. This way, we perceived immigrants would more likely feel comfortable and feel active and safe in the conversation.

                    Throughout the different iterations of our design and the different iterations over the elements of our solution, we progressed from first thinking about the technology background and overall plan of the agenda, to better explaining elements of our co-design session to our participants to making sure our participants felt comfortable and ready to share their opinions. Although the beginning sessions are useful for planning and making sure that the event goes smoothly, logistically, the more important iterations happened in the latter part of our project; if participants do not feel comfortable, emotionally-safe, and supported, especially while having potentially embarrassing or sensitive conversations, there will be no way to have an equitable co-design session between all parties. <br><br>
                    After coming to our final iteration, we synthesized our elements into a cohesive final presentation pitch, prepared to deliver to the church members and administrators of Iglesia de Cristo Camino de Santidad in South Los Angeles, in an effort to present the value of our co-design to their community and to ask for the use of their space one Sunday after service and the promotion of the session to their congregation. Through our presentation, we began with our ask for their space in encouragement in recruiting participants, and then highlighted the problem we saw that faced their community: the issue of the signing of unlawful housing contracts by legal Hispanic immigrants because of language barriers, cultural barriers, and lack of subject-matter expertise. We elaborated upon our goal of empowering Hispanic legal immigrants in South Los Angeles to understand and to not sign unlawful contracts at the beginning of their search to find new housing, and later explained the setting, context, time, and participants involved in the co-design session. <br><br>
                    Then, we walked our audience through the session, highlighting the reasoning behind each step, explaining the support and resources to help guide the session. Finally, we showed examples of potential solutions participants could find during the co-design session and described the value of our session: to co-design several feasible solutions that will help legal immigrants recognize illegal housing contracts and to reduce the amount of signed unlawful housing contracts by immigrants by empowering immigrants to take precaution.

                    Our next steps would have been to evaluate the effectiveness of our co-design session against metrics, such as how comfortable, empowered, and correctly our audience could now recognize unfair housing clauses, as well as how successful information dissemination campaigns in local neighborhoods about housing contract literacy were. After evaluating the effects of our co-design session, we would be able to revise future co-design sessions to further opportunities to empower our audience. <br>
