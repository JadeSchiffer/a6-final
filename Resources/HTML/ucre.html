                     During my User-Centered Research and    Evaluation class, we learned common methods of user testing as seen in UX research and deployed them in our own studies to better evaluate how users perceive, enjoy, and understand the design of products and services around them. The first half of the class was a user testing and re-design of a Pittsburgh service, as seen in the When There's a Wheel, There's a Way project also on this site, and the second half of the class was learning more about user testing through smaller, and more individually-based projects. Through learning about and then employing a diverse set of user testing practices, I was able to better understand and design for intended audiences. Below are a few of the highlights from the second portion of my User-Centered Research and Evaluation class, the more individual deployment of user testing.

                     In Think Alouds, researchers ask users to think out loud while accomplishing various tasks in a usability testing of a product. <br><br>
                    The Reason<br><br> The main reason of using Think Alouds it to understand how users feel, think, and perceive different aspects of your product. Whereas other methods better tell you where people look or how long it might take to do different tasks, think alouds better tell you why people take certain actions or how they feel about those actions. <br><br>
                    The Steps<br><br> Before the Think Aloud begins, start a test plan of how you will conduct the think aloud, and come up with some hypotheses you would like to test for during the think aloud. First, you introduce how a think aloud works, perhaps by performing a think aloud yourself first in order to guide participants. Make sure they understand, and have participants sign a consent form. Then, you introduce the tasks you would like the participants to perform. During their think aloud, you simply observe, answering as few questions as possible and being as silent as possible so not to bias their think aloud in any way. Afterwards, you thank the participants and debrief. Once the participants have finished the think aloud, you code for issues, seeing what issues were most problematic for participants. They may prove or disprove your hypothesis. Afterwards, you think of next steps to resolve critical issues. <br><br>
                    The Example<br><br> In class, we each selected a site to lead users to conduct a Think Aloud. I chose Workday, the CMU on-campus job time approval site. I believed that there were many issues inhibiting the usability of Workday, so I came up with a test plan, hypotheses, executed a think aloud, and then coded for critical issues, some of which proved my hypotheses. Some challenges included not engaging too much with participants during the session, as well as reminding participants to continue thinking out loud instead of to themselves. Once I reviewed my notes, I was able to code for critical issues, noting overlaps between the two participants, such as misunderstanding of error messages or inability to find the Submit button to submit their time worked. Afterwards, I was able to make recommendation for what changes Workday should execute first (for example, a more clear Submit button), based on the tasks I had the participants perform and the difficulties they had due to confusing design. <br><br>

                     A/B testing compares two iterations of a web page in order to see which one optimizes the conversion rate for its users. By splitting traffic between the two version of the web page (version A and version B) at the same time, researchers are able to see which version of the page optimizes the conversion rate for better results. A/B testing is a simple way to compare two versions of a page in order to show a causal link between the page design and an optimized conversion rate. <br><br>
                     The Reason <br><br> The main reason to use A/B testing is   to test what version of a site users prefer by seeing which one optimizes conversion rates. Researchers may have biased opinions about which version of a site is better, but the true way to tell is to test users and see which one they respond to the best, through their actions. Whereas A/B testing can tell you which version of a page performs better, unfortunately, it will not tell you why it performs better or a user’s perceptions of the page. It strictly just tells you which one is better, through the actions of a user on the site. <br><br>
                     The Steps <br><br> In order to perform A/B testing, it would be useful if the researchers first had some hypotheses or research that showed what the critical issues were in the current design. A method such as a think aloud would tell researchers what critical issues were, so they could use that data to inform their redesigns. Next, the researcher would design two versions of the web page and have a clear idea of how to measure success with each version (ie, more people sign up with one version or more people click submit on one version). Then, the researcher would send the two versions of the page out to users, splitting traffic between the two versions at the same time. Afterwards, the researcher would see which page was more successful. Then, the researcher would either use that new design or perhaps make another redesign and compare the successful page from the previous trial with the new redesign in another cycle of A/B testing. <br><br>
                     The Example <br><br> After having users perform Think Alouds on the Workday site, I made a test plan for an A/B test, had I the resources to actual accomplish an A/B test at the time. First, I looked at the critical issues the users had with Workday, and then I looked at the baseline of Workday currently looks like. Then, I came up with hypotheses about how to fix the critical issues, and I redesigned two versions of the page, designed to minimize the effects of the critical issues (focusing on making the Submit button more clear). Afterwards, I brainstormed how to measure success, which I decided would be less time spent by users figuring out where the “Submit” button was on the page, and then I made the test plan to split traffic among the two versions. Had I been able to do that, I would have seen which version performed better/ users took less time to find the Submit button, and then I would have known which redesign to implement on the original site.

                    <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                     Heuristic Evaluation is a method in which researchers select a group of heuristics, or recognized usability principles, and then create personas in order to identify usability problems for different types of users in an user interface, using those heuristics. <br> <br>
                     The Reason<br> <br> Heuristic Evaluation is a cheap and fast way to discover how an interface meets or doesn’t meet a user’s preferences, goals, and needs. Like Think Alouds, Heuristic Evaluation tells researchers how people feel and perceive going through certain actions on a site. However, the different is that Heuristic Evaluations are performed by researchers taking on the personas of users, not the users themselves. Therefore, there is an element of researcher bias, since this method is not conducted with primary users. However, it is faster and cheaper because researchers will not have to go out and find users for these studies. <br> <br>
                     The Steps<br> <br> First, researchers find a website to evaluate the user interface. Then, researchers determine use cases, or actions users would take on the website. Afterwards, researchers find a set of heuristics, or usability principles, to evaluate these elements of the interface. Then, they create personas of typical users that reflect the kinds of consumers who use the site. After walking the personas through the use case, they document UARs (Usability Aspect Reports) or issues that the personas have encountered while accomplishing the different use cases. Finally, UARs are grouped thematically, so researchers can see the general themes that are leading to these issues personas face in order to make recommendations for design changes to the interface. <br> <br>
                     The Example<br> <br> In a team, my group members and I chose Craigslist’s interface to evaluate. We chose use cases for typical actions users would take on Craigslist, and used Nielsen’s list of heuristics to evaluate the usability of the sites. Then, we came up with personas that would likely use Craigslist, such as savvy shoppers, people on the go, students, etc, and walked our personas through various use cases, documenting UARs we felt our personas would have throughout these use cases. Then, we grouped our UARs thematically and found that many of the issues between personas were similar, leading to trends in the kinds of issues Craigslist users may have, such as difficulties with amount of text on the screen or fake buttons. Finally, we made recommendations for interface redesign, based on the thematic groupings of our UARs. <br> <br>
