                    My User-Centered Research and Evaluation class was tasked with redesigning Pittsburgh public services for our client, Mayor Peduto of Pittsburgh. Through better understanding the pain points of Pittsburgh public buses, my team was able to better understand riders’ needs of better accessibility and predictability for the bus system. We were able to redesign an easy ramp system to alleviate accessibility issues and a smart bus system to circumvent oncoming traffic in bus routes to alleviate predictability issues. After presenting our findings to Mayor Peduto, he said that he looks forward to welcoming new technologies to bring our solutions into play.

                    In the first half of my User-Centered Research and Evaluation class, my team, Anny Fan, Steven Ji, Hannah Kim, and I were tasked with re-designing a Pittsburgh service. After looking at housing systems, transportation systems, clean air systems, and more, we decided to look at Pittsburgh transportation systems, specifically the Pittsburgh local bus system because we believe transportation was both a good that reaches everyone, as well as one where there a huge differences in the levels of accessibility, bringing room for improvement.

                    In order to best understand Pittsburgh buses, we had to think outside of how we, as students, experienced them. We recognized that we represent just one portion of bus riders, so we set out to interview a wide variety of bus takers in order to understand their pain points and brainstorm better ways to design a public transportation system. Through our chosen interview method of contextual inquiries, or interviewing subjects while they are in the context of the experience we are interviewing them regarding, we talked to other students, middle-aged professionals, retired bus takers, and daily commuters in order to best understand how they experience the Pittsburgh bus system. Simultaneously, we interviewed transportation experts (researchers and professors in the particular field of transportation improvement) to better understand what feasible solutions may exist in the future and what roadblocks have already been hit.

                    After interviewing a 4-6 subjects from each subject pool, we started transcribing and analyzing our interviews. We had audio recorded, video recorded, and taken notes during each 30-60 minute interview, and we set out to glean as many insights into bus experiences as we could through analyzing our conversations. From there, we wrote or typed out our observations, one on each sticky note, in order to create an affinity diagram, a bottoms up or drilling up exercise where we look at each insight, group them under more general insights, which are then grouped under overall themes and concerns, moving from the most granular insights to the most wide insights. After collecting our insights, we realized that the two largest concern bus takers had were accessibility and timing. Recent transportation policy had eliminated the front handicap-accessible ramp to exit the bus, and differently-abled riders felt that exiting the bus was now significantly more difficult than it used to be, comparing it to a mad dash to get all the way to the back of the bus in time to ask the bus driver to trigger the exit ramp. Furthermore, many bus riders were disheartened by the time it took to get to their destinations, citing late buses and subsequently overcrowded buses and traffic as extremely tiring in their experiences..

                    After interviewing a 4-6 subjects from each subject  With these two chief complaints in mind, we sought to look at a wide variety of possible solutions and decided to examine the context of a rider’s journey through different lenses: flow diagrams, cultural diagrams, sequence diagrams, and physical diagrams. Each of my teammates and I then split up our interviewees and constructed these diagrams for each of them. One example is the context of one of our riders, Elaine’s, journey throughout her commute. Elaine was a middle-aged professional living in the suburbs of Pittsburgh who took the bus as one of her many sources of transportation to get into downtown Pittsburgh for work every day. Through the flow diagram, I explored the different flows that existed between Elaine and the different components of her commute, seeking to better understand the interactions between each element. Through the cultural diagram, I zeroed in on Elaine and the bus system, specifically looking for areas of dissonance and overlap during the commute. During the sequence diagram, I looked more closely at the sequence of events Elaine experiences every step of her commute, seeing how the different steps may affect each other along the way. Lastly, in the physical diagram, I looked at the physical context of the bus, mapping out spatial relationships between different elements. From these different diagrams, I was able to zero in on a number of factors, supported by what Elaine described in her interview, that affected her tense commute, most notably: the sheer number of steps she had to take to access a public bus, the time spent waiting between those different steps, and the variability in her schedule that public transportation affects through late bus arrivals and few and far between arriving buses.

                    After separately creating these diagrams, my team came back together to synthesize our learnings and discover personas and their journey maps to better understand typical commutes from different perspectives. Recognizing that our specific interviewees may have exclusive experiences, we sought to group their experiences into personas that typify Pittsburgh bus riders and realize their common journeys through journey maps. Working together, we constructed personas and journey maps for a student, a younger professional, an older professional, and a retired bus rider, focusing on the common points interviewees grouped into each persona had. We thought about each persona’s motivations, short and long-term goals, and needs when taking the bus and tried to match these factors to the parts in their journey that do not fulfill them, looking for opportunities to better their experience.

                    Our final solution was to zero in on the two most prevalent pain points: accessibility and timing, and find ways to alleviate that through technology re-design. First, we looked at the inaccessibility issue of the exit ramp only in the back exit and decided to tackle the issue not by fighting policy, but by providing a go-around with technology. We designed the Easy Ramp system, triggered by a button under the stop buttons on bus poles. When a differently-abled rider boards the bus, they are able to see Easy Ramp buttons on each pole, and they are able to select both a stop button and the Easy Ramp button to signal to the bus driver ahead of time that they will be exiting at the next stop and will require the exit ramp in the back. This way, both rider and drivers are able to prepare to exit the bus ahead of time with the easy ramp, diminishing the “mad dash” effect differently-abled riders are currently experiencing. In order to address timing, traffic, and overcrowding issues on the bus, we designed a “Smart Bus” system that feeds in traffic data from Google Maps and is able to take alternate routes to circumvent traffic jams along the way, leading to diminished wait times and less crowded buses that are able to arrive more quickly at each stop. However, we chose to focus our solution on the Easy Ramp button because we believe that the “Smart Bus” system would be a significantly harder, more expensive, and less feasible option at least in the next few years.

                    Once each team in my class presented its findings, the next step was to bring our solutions to our client, Mayor Peduto of Pittsburgh. Representatives from each service area were chosen, and I was able to have the opportunity to present my team’s findings to Mayor Peduto. After presenting, Mayor Peduto agreed that there were significant gaps inPittsburgh bus experiences and stated that he looked forward to new technological inventions to help bridge those gaps.
