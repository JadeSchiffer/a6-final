                    I worked in a team of three including Courtney Left, Hannah Rosen, and myself to create a climate change and biodiversity dashboard of Sub-Saharan Africa in order to convey data points from scientists to national policy makers at a climate change summit. By reconciling scientific information with its tangible effects in agricultural profits lost, our dashboard aims to provide real-time updates to policy makers so that they can proactively create policy around climate change and biodiversity for a healthier farming environment, which leads to a healthier economy.

                    Throughout our research about biodiversity and climate change threats in Sub-Saharan Africa, we noticed a recurring them: Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the least threatening countries in terms of responsibility for climate change threats and one of the most threatened countries because of climate change threats from other countries. Sub- Saharan Africa is threatened by a range of climate change themes: location and weather threats, plant and animal threats, and human activity threats. The location of Sub- Saharan Africa coupled with climate change has led to warming trends in the region, decreases in rainfall, and a doubling of the rate of weather-related disasters (particularly floods and droughts). Since Sub-Saharan Africa is such a huge region, there are four main subregions, each with a different climate: dry West Africa, the tropical dry Central Africa, the wet tropics of West Africa, and the mediterranean Southern Africa. These weather trends have also increased rainfall to West and Central Africa while decreasing rainfall in Southern Africa, devastating plant and animal populations. Furthermore, since variability in rainfall is one of the largest issues, it is scaring away potential investors. This variability is projected to lead to worse production seasons, leading to increased poverty, malnutrition, and the spread of infectious diseases, as rural farmers continue to flood to urban areas, with both populations ill-prepared for different types of disease. As more populations flood urban areas and the AIDS epidemic continues to affect both rural and urban populations alike, rural and agricultural Sub-Saharan Africa is left with a lower working population and a scarcity of people to farm crops. <br>
                    In order to find the key indicators of climate change to inform how policy makers should combat these various threats, we chose to focus on what makes Sub-Saharan Africa unique in terms of biodiversity and climates. Since so much of the continent’s GDP comes from agriculture (up to 30% of the GDP in some years), the scarcity of people coupled with the natural disasters sweeping the region leads to less crops and less crop revenue. Therefore, the key indicators we chose to focus on were soil availability, droughts, floods, urban migration, and declining crop populations. On one hand, droughts and floods decrease soil availability and on the other hand, urban migration decreases working agricultural populations, so those two groups of factors combined lead to declining crop populations, which is directly linked to declining agricultural revenue.

                    For our beginning sketches, we had two main ideas: representing our dashboard in one, holistic view of Sub-Saharan Africa and representing our dashboard through its component parts, the different key threats to various regions. In the one, holistic view of Sub-Saharan Africa, we thought about representing the different key indicators throughout the continent, animating the effects the key indicators had on the region over time.

                    Although this was visually pleasing, after receiving feedback on this idea, we realized that it was not nearly thorough enough, focusing more on a simple visual without diving deeply into complex data and information. By focusing on representing the region through separate data visualizations for each key indicator, we were able to work with a variety of data sets, capturing the true essence of each key indicator and its fluctuations throughout the years. However, as we looked at our different visualizations, we realized that the best visualization might be a combination of the two parts— looking at specific key indicators through charts while having synthesizing information on a large, more holistic map. Although we explored many different visualizations, we eventually came back to the idea of a holistic, big-picture map with more specific data to accompany it on smaller graphs. <br>
                    Besides the overall feedback that it was important to have detailed data visualizations for the key indicators instead of just a holistic overview of threats for the region, we also received feedback about what else worked and what else didn't work. We learned that some of our data visualization was confusing, either because axes weren’t labeled or because what we were trying to convey through the visualization wasn’t what was actually being conveyed. We learned our waste management graph wasn’t particularly effective, and that people wanted more details into the visualizations of key indicators (what crops are providing the most revenue? the least?). People liked our story of how urbanization and migratory patterns affect the biodiversity of crops, and we were encouraged to use that mindset, the story-telling mindset, to inform our future designs. In general, we learned that we needed more content along with a stronger narration tying together the different component parts in order to tell a clear story to policy makers about combatting climate change and biodiversity threats.

                    After receiving feedback on what worked and didn’t work, we started immediately iterating over our ideas, trying to sketch as many ideas in as many different directions as possible. We tried to represent our migratory graph linearly, we tried using the map of Sub- Saharan Africa as a starting point for using call-outs to different countries in the four regions of Sub-Saharan Africa to show how these four countries were combatting biodiversity and climate change threats, and we tried showing separate climate change pattern graphs for the four different regions. After trying all these different ideas and not knowing exactly where to move next, we decided we should talk a bit about the scope of our project to see how to narrow down to our immediate path of action.

                    After speaking a bit about how to digital iterate through some of the ideas we’ve sketched, we came to the idea of having a concrete point of entrance for our policy makers, a large, holistic overview of the challenges in the region, supported by smaller data visualization graphs and charts. We also decided that the five key factors we should concentrate on are migratory patterns, biodiversity and reduction of crops, rainfall and weather variability, the decrease in the agricultural workforce, and the decrease in soil availability. We knew migratory patterns and a decrease in the quantity and profits from crops were going to be two of our largest focal points, and from that, we had several ideas on how to depict those points. The majority of the dashboards we designed at this initial digital iteration stage focused on either migration patterns and what that meant for profits in Sub-Saharan Africa or how the reduction of certain categories of crops was leading to a potential loss in profit for the agricultural sector, one of the dominant categories for Sub- Saharan Africa’s GDP. After trying a variety of dashboards, with each of us focusing our efforts on one dashboard layout, we came to the conclusion that potential profit lost in crop revenue should be our main focal point and the other four critical indicators should tell a story about the relationships between themselves and their impact on crop revenue.

                    After receiving feedback on what worked and didn’t work on our first digital dashboards, we narrowed down our focus to creating two other digital dashboards, using the features our classmates and professors found most clear, concise, and representative of our data sets. On one of our dashboards, we experimented with the idea of having four countries, characteristic of each of the four subregions of Sub-Saharan Africa, showing data regarding the key indicators for each of those four countries. After receiving much more positive feedback on the above dashboard, with the main criticism of this dashboard being that the information was cognitive overload because of its physical spread and information depth, we decided to focus on a different dashboard moving forward.

                    For our other dashboard, since we received positive feedback on focusing our dashboard around lost possible crop revenue as well as using linear graphs to depict lost possible crop revenue, one of our new dashboards focused on that lost crop revenue. We later added a preferred future to show how potential profits could arise given chances in policy and farming incentives. We also added a lefthand sidebar to show the components that make up the current losses in potential profits to show that urbanization is one of the largest and growing components, hoping that that data would inspire policy makers to consider more strongly subsidizing farming in an effort to slow down urbanization. As a deeper dive into the components that make up that potential loss, we visualized those key indicators on an area map of Sub-Saharan Africa, showing growing trends in climate change indicators over time, and we also added a depiction of a shrinking agricultural workforce, emphasizing the effects of urbanization. After feedback we learned that the map of Africa might be confusing, and it might be a better idea to just show how much available soil still remains, if that is the main point we are trying to convey. We also were advised to play around with different formations for our agricultural workforce visualization.

                    After deciding to move forward with our dashboard that focused on agricultural revenue decline, we wanted to make sure our colors would pop against a black background while still enforcing cognitive links between colors and the way they are perceived; we chose green for agricultural workers, healthy crops, and agricultural growth, red to indicate urbanization, blue to represent floods, and yellow to represent droughts initially. Although we felt these colors were pleasing to the eye and made sense considering what they represented, when we set the dashboard in gray-scale, it was clear that the contrast between the colors was not sufficient and they did not stand out against each other. Moving forward, we played with a more neon palette, favoring choices like neon green for healthy crops, agricultural workforce and agricultural revenue, orange for urbanization, and light pink and hot pink for droughts and floods. Although these colors popped against the black background, we were distraught by the lack of coherence they had with what key indicators they were representing and that they did not seem like a sophisticated color palette, fitting for a panel of policy makers at a conference on climate change.

                    After selecting some color palettes to work on, we tried to incorporate color into our dashboard while also making conceptual changes to various elements on the dashboard. We first tried the neon palette, temporarily taking out the map of Africa until we figured out how best to show available soil left for farming. Although the neon colors popped against a black background, we were still dissatisfied with that bright color palette. Next, we tried returning to the idea of mapping colors to the key indicators they represented, but we didn’t quite like how the colors mapped against each other, since we felt they did not seem part of one coherent palette. Lastly, we tried swapping colors between the two above palettes, placing neons next to more natural colors. While this was slightly better, we still were not too found of neons, so we asked for feedback on our color palette, yielding the color palette on the top right of the third dashboard, with green for crops, yellow for droughts, grey for floods, and orange for urbanization. We felt that this color palette better mapped colors to key indicators, while emphasizing the contrast between the various colors, so we were very grateful to be pointed in a better direction. We also added the map of Africa back into this latest iteration, showing the different key indicators that lead to a lack of available farmland, as well as an indicator when the threshold of not enough available farmland to feed Sub-Saharan Africa is reached (the white dotted line across the map of Africa). However, we received feedback that this visualization was particularly confusing since it both implied that only certain regions of Africa are affected by floods and droughts, that using area to indicate quantity is leading to cognitive dissonance, and that maps without data to explain them give readers the feeling that the data is not precise or available. Therefore, as we moved towards our final solution, we sought to keep our last color palette while fixing the map of Africa to better and more quantitatively depict the key indicators that are leading to soil unavailability and climate change.

                    After choosing what would be our final color palette and before we thought about how to redo our map of Africa in order to more clearly represent quantity of soil available and not geography, we started working on possibilities for animation. We knew we wanted to link our key indicators together to show that urbanization decreases a workforce, while droughts and floods decrease soil available for farming, which in turn, decreases crop revenue. However, we needed to find a way to indicate that through our animations and not in spite of our animations. Therefore, we sought to connect that by showing our crops lost and declining workforce change colors as floods, droughts, and urbanization reduce the amount of healthy crops and agricultural workforce, and our green visualizations of crops and people slowly turn into the color of the key indicator they have fallen prey to; we also had the area in the map of Africa increase, moving upwards to meet the threshold, revealing that the increase in droughts, floods, and urbanization are decreasing the amount of soil available until a critical point where the area available for farming is not enough to sustain the country. Furthermore, we echoes this in having the percentages in our lefthand circle chart increase, as these critical indicators grow over time, reducing the amount of crops that can be produced, and in turn, reducing the amount of revenue that can be made. We also animated the loss in potential profits in the lefthand sidebar in order to clearly show that the number is growing more and more negatively as these critical indicators grow in magnitude.

                    After receiving feedback on our first animations, we sought to make our revised animations more elegant, data-driven and dramatic. Whereas we first had our loss in profits ticker slowly and subtly increasing, as we further iterated, we decided to speed up the pace of our ticker while also having the ticker display loss in bright red every time it reached a new threshold of an additional billion dollars lost in profit. While the number would pulse in a bright red, the background of the lefthand bar would also grow to a warmer hue, drawing attention away from the other parts of the dashboard and back to the ticker, alerting policy makers to an additional billion loss in crop profit. Towards the center of our dashboard, we used our new area map that signifies both geographic placement and quantity in animation as well, having the colored areas in the call-outs change length in accordance to proportion of area within the country lost to each particular climate change indicator. This fluctuates gradually, showing the relationships between the key indicators and how they come together to affect crop profit decline. Finally, we animated our crops lost and workforce lost visualizations by showing the different turning points as key climate change factors grow in magnitude and overwhelm the healthy workforce and crops. We animated this by having the green squares, healthy crops and workforce, slowly pulse and turn to the color of the key indicator they have fallen to— for example, as droughts take out healthy crops, green squares pulse and turn yellow. By emphasizing this conversion, we sought to emphasize the relationship between the different indicators.

                    We liked that the red pulsing of the loss in profits number would potentially bring the policy makers’ attention back to the lefthand sidebar, reminding them that immediate policy action is required in order to slow down and potentially reverse the effects of climate change on total crop revenue. However, we also felt that we could draw attention to the lefthand sidebar by appealing to more than one sense— through sound, as well as vision. Therefore, we started iterating through different sound accompaniments for our bright red loss in profits. We started with a few sounds that were much too high-pitched— they sounded more like alarms than alerts. As we moved toward lower pitches, we came to the sound we ended up using for our final dashboard: a sound with a medium pitch. However, after presenting our final dashboard, we received feedback that the sound we chose was still too startling, making users think that something is wrong with the system. With more time, we would want to look towards pitches with an even lower pitch, as well as a warmer timbre in order to warmly guide policy makers’ attention back towards the system. However, we would want the pitch and timbre of this sound to have a certain amount of urgency to it, without startling users like our higher-pitched sounds did. Therefore, we would have to find a trade-off between startling our users and prompting them towards taking action.

                    After reconciling all our different ideas and feedback, we produced a final solution that reconciled the data from the scientists with the users, the policy makers. In this, we focused on a broad picture that emphasized how the impact of climate change indicators such as declining soil availability because of floods and droughts coupled with crops lost because of a declining workforce and climate change effects bring about a declining total crop revenue moving forward. We wanted to draw special attention to an overall loss in crop profits, which we highlighted in the lefthand side bar through a difference in background color, as well as the use of a bright red color, animation, and sound to indicate when economic thresholds have been crossed. We also used animation in order to show the relationships between the key indicators and included both a current look at decreasing crop profits and a preferred future in order to give policy makers a comparison of where they are now and where they could go. By providing this historical data, we also sought to inform policy makers of past trends so that they could predict future patterns. Through drawing attention to how these key indicators relate to each other and influence each other while keeping track of an increase in loss of profits, we hoped to inspire policy makers to take action in order to bring written policy to slow down the effects of urbanization and incentivize farming.

                    With additional time, we would have hoped to explore our data more to understand the complex relationships between the climate change and biodiversity indicators even more strongly. We would have also wanted to look into best practices for animating data, as well as for inspiring policy makers. We would further look towards data on the effects of lobbying, as well data specific for policy makers in Sub-Saharan Africa. In regards to sound, we would want to find a better solution for a sound that catches the attention of policy makers, but does not make them think something with our dashboard is wrong; instead we want them to understand that something in the data has fallen awry. We would have also liked to have looked more into the cultural implications of our suggestions, as well as the financial implications of our suggestions— what budgets would have to be cut in order for our implied programs to be implemented? <br>Moving forward, we would want to use that additional data to inform our dashboard design to make it a more individually-marketed design for policy makers in Sub-Saharan Africa to better understand their environment and constituents. <br>
